# NETCOM CAPSTONE

## Anomaly Detection Web Application using Dynamic Ensembles and SHAP Explanations

### Heinz College - Spring 2022

----

The purpose of our project was to help NETCOM understand the effectiveness of anomaly detection
models in use cases pertinent to the Command’s mission and effectively incorporate these models
into its current workflow. We accomplished this through an extension to NETCOM’s existing
Apache Airflow malicious URL detection pipeline. We developed an additional Directed Acyclic
Graph to engineer features, run four anomaly detection algorithms (xStream, isolation forests, local
outlier factor, and one-class spanning vector machine), and generate Shapley Additive Explanations
for the data. We then present these results and explanations in a web-interface of our own design.
Finally, we encapsulate our work within a sample risk framework to show how it can contribute to
cyber risk management practices both on the front line and across the Command.
